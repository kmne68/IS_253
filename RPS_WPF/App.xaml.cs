 * RPS is a simple rock, paper, scissors game. The program asks the user for
 * his/her choice, gets a random choice for the computer then determines
 * whether the player or the computer has won using the familiar rules of the
 * game. This iteration implements the WPF version of the game by adding it
 * to the solution as a separate project. This version is substantially similar
 * logically to the console and windows form versions of the game and is 
 * primarily for experiencing the WPF environment.
